To run this DKVMN implementation, you'll need to follow these steps:

First, save the code to a Python file (e.g., dkvmn.py).
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

bashCopypip install torch numpy scikit-learn

For a quick test with the dummy data already included in the code, you can simply run:

bashCopypython dkvmn.py
This will execute the main() function, which creates a model with dummy data and runs 5 training epochs.

To use it with your own educational data, you'll need to:
a. Prepare your data in the right format:

Questions/skills represented as integers
Answers represented as 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct)
Data organized in sequences (e.g., each student's interaction history)

b. Modify the main() function to load your own data:
pythonCopy# Replace the dummy data creation with your data loading
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Load your data
# q_data shape: [num_students, seq_len]
# a_data shape: [num_students, seq_len]
q_data = your_question_data
a_data = your_answer_data

train_dataset = TensorDataset(q_data, a_data)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# You'd typically split into train/val/test
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# (add code for proper data splitting)

Adjust the hyperparameters to match your dataset:

pythonCopy# Set these to match your dataset
num_questions = YOUR_TOTAL_QUESTION_COUNT
dim_key = 64  # Can be tuned
dim_value = 128  # Can be tuned
dim_hidden = 64  # Can be tuned

For a more complete training script, you would typically add:

Model checkpointing to save the best model
Early stopping based on validation loss
Learning rate scheduling



Would you like me to help you with any specific aspect of running this model or adapting it for your particular dataset?
