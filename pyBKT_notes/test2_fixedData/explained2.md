### **pyBKT Test Script with Fixed Data from CSV**

This script is designed to load a fixed dataset from a CSV file, train a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, and verify that the model is functioning correctly. The process includes evaluating model parameters, making predictions, and visualizing learning curves for a specific student.

#### **Libraries:**

* `numpy`: For numerical operations.  
* `pandas`: For loading and manipulating data.  
* `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting visualizations.  
* `pyBKT`: For Bayesian Knowledge Tracing.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Load Data**:  
   The script begins by loading a pre-existing dataset from a CSV file. The data is expected to have columns like `user_id`, `skill_name`, `correct`, and `order_id`.  
2. **Train the BKT Model**:  
   It then initializes a `Model` instance from `pyBKT` and fits it using the loaded data.  
3. **Verify Model Parameters**:  
   After training, the script extracts the learned parameters (prior knowledge, learning probability, guessing probability, and slipping probability) and displays them.  
4. **Make Predictions**:  
   The model is used to make predictions about the student responses in the dataset. The predictions include whether each student answered each question correctly.  
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**:  
   The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted answers to the actual answers.  
6. **Visualize Learning Curve**:  
   The script generates a plot of a specific student's learning trajectory, showing the probability of skill mastery over time and comparing it to their actual answers.
