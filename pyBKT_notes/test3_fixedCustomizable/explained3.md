### **pyBKT Test Script with Fixed Data from CSV extended**

This script loads real student response data, trains a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model with customized parameters, evaluates its performance, and visualizes learning curves for multiple students.

Difference between test2 and test3:

**Parameters:**

* **First Script:** Uses default model parameters.  
* **Second Script:** Allows for customization of model parameters (e.g., prior, learns, guesses, etc.).

**Visualization:**

* **First Script:** Plots the learning curve for only one student.  
* **Second Script:** Plots the learning curves for multiple students.

**Parameter Handling:**

* **First Script:** Simply prints learned parameters.  
* **Second Script:** Extracts and prints individual parameter values, giving more insight into how the modelâ€™s parameters evolve.

**Plot File:**

* **First Script:** Saves the plot of the learning curve for a single student.  
* **Second Script:** Saves the plot for multiple students.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Loading Fixed Data**:  
   The script begins by loading a pre-existing dataset (`fixed_data.csv`) that contains real student responses.  
   This dataset is assumed to have columns like `user_id`, `order_id`, `correct`, and `skill_name`.  
2. **Training the BKT Model**:  
   The script proceeds to train the BKT model using the loaded data. Parameters for prior knowledge, learning, guessing, slipping, and forgetting are explicitly set during the training process.  
   The `defaults` argument is used to initialize these parameters, which helps configure the model to match a specific learning scenario.  
3. **Verifying Model Parameters**:  
   After training, the model's learned parameters (prior, learning rate, guessing rate, slipping rate) are printed and verified. The values should be close to the predefined ones (e.g., prior should be around 0.3, learning rate around 0.1).  
   The script includes error handling in case the parameters are not extracted correctly.  
4. **Making Predictions**:  
   The model is then used to make predictions based on the fixed dataset, and a sample of these predictions is printed to examine the model's output.  
5. **Evaluating Model Performance**:  
   The accuracy of the model is computed by comparing the predicted answers to the actual answers from the dataset. The prediction is considered correct if the predicted probability is greater than 0.5.  
6. **Visualizing Learning Curves for Multiple Students**:  
   The script visualizes the learning curves for multiple students by plotting the probability of skill mastery for each student over the sequence of questions.  
   The learning curves are saved as an image (`pyBKT_learning_curves.png`), and a grid is added to help identify trends.
