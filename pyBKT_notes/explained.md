This script is a basic test for the pyBKT (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) model. 
Purpose: The script creates synthetic data to simulate student responses, trains a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, and verifies that the model's implementation is functioning correctly.
Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations,
pandas for data manipulation,
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting,
pyBKT for the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model.




```python
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Load your data
# q_data shape: [num_students, seq_len]
# a_data shape: [num_students, seq_len]
q_data = your_question_data
a_data = your_answer_data

train_dataset = TensorDataset(q_data, a_data)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Split into train/validation/test
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# (Add code for proper data splitting)
```
