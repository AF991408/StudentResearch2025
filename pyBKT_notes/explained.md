This script is a basic test for the `pyBKT` (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) model. 

* **Purpose**: The script creates synthetic data to simulate student responses, trains a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, and verifies that the model's implementation is functioning correctly.  
* **Libraries**:  
  * `numpy` for numerical operations,  
  * `pandas` for data manipulation,  
  * `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting,  
  * `pyBKT` for the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model.  
      
1. **Synthetic Data Creation**:  
   * The script starts by generating synthetic data for 50 students answering 10 questions related to a single skill.  
   * Each student has a 30% chance of knowing the skill initially. They can learn the skill with a 10% chance per question.
   * The probability of answering correctly depends on whether the student knows the skill or not:  
     * If they know the skill, they have a 90% chance of getting the answer correct (10% chance of a slip).  
     * If they don’t know the skill, they have a 20% chance of guessing correctly.  
   * The data is stored in a list of dictionaries, which is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
```python
# Step 1: Create synthetic data
print("Step 1: Creating synthetic data...")
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility

# Create a simple dataset: 50 students answering 10 questions on 1 skill
num_students = 50
num_questions = 10

# Initialize empty list to store data
data = []

# Generate synthetic student responses
for student in range(num_students):
    # Logic for generating responses...

``` 
2. **Training the BKT Model**:  
   * The script initializes a `Model` instance from `pyBKT` and fits it using the synthetic data.
```python
# Step 2: Train BKT model
print("\nStep 2: Training BKT model...")
model = Model()
model.fit(data=df)
``` 
3. **Verifying Model Parameters**:  
   * After training, it retrieves the learned parameters (e.g., prior knowledge, learning probability, guessing probability, and slipping probability).  
   * It checks if these parameters are reasonable based on expected values.
```python
# Step 3: Verify parameters
print("\nStep 3: Verifying model parameters...")
params = model.params()
# Logic for checking parameter values...
``` 
4. **Making Predictions**:  
   * The model is used to make predictions on the synthetic dataset.  
   * The predictions include whether each student answered each question correctly, and the results are displayed.
```python
# Step 4: Make predictions
print("\nStep 4: Making predictions...")
predictions = model.predict(data=df)
# Logic for displaying predictions...
```  
5. **Evaluating Model Performance**:  
   * The script calculates the prediction accuracy by comparing predicted answers to actual answers and displays the result.
```python
# Step 5: Evaluate model performance
print("\nStep 5: Evaluating model performance...")
# Logic for calculating accuracy...
```  
6. **Visualizing Learning Curve**:  
   * The script generates a plot of a specific student's learning trajectory over time.  
   * It shows the probability of skill mastery (posterior) alongside the actual answers (correct/incorrect) to visualize how the student's knowledge develops.
```python
# Step 6: Visualize learning curve for a student
print("\nStep 6: Visualizing learning curve...")
# Logic for plotting the learning curve...
```  
7. **Error Handling**:  
   * The script includes error handling to manage any unexpected issues that arise during execution, such as problems with parameter extraction or plotting.

### **Final Output**

* After running all steps, it prints whether the test was successful and provides any errors encountered. It also saves the learning curve plot as an image file.

This test script is useful for ensuring that the `pyBKT` implementation is working correctly and can help you understand how Bayesian Knowledge Tracing operates by simulating student learning scenarios.
