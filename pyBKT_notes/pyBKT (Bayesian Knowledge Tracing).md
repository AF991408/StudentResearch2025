### **pyBKT (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing):**

pyBKT uses a probabilistic approach to estimate how likely a student is to know a skill based on their responses to questions over time.

* **Main Idea**: It tracks whether a student knows a skill or not by using things like their initial knowledge, how much they learn, how likely they are to guess correctly, and how likely they are to make mistakes.  
* **How it works**: The model updates the student’s knowledge after each question, assuming they either know the skill or not, and adjusts based on whether they answered correctly or not.  
* **When to use**: pyBKT is good for simpler environments where you want to track a student’s progress on specific skills, especially when you have smaller datasets and don’t need a complex model.

**Complexity**: pyBKT is simple because it uses probabilities and doesn’t need complex neural networks or a lot of data.

**Accuracy**: pyBKT gives good estimates of student knowledge, but it might not be as accurate in more complex situations or with bigger datasets, where models like DKVMN could do better.
