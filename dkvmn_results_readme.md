# DKVMN Model Results and Metrics

The results you'll see from running the DKVMN model provide insights into how well the model is predicting student responses. After training, you'll see something like:

```
Epoch: 1, Loss: 0.XXXX  
Epoch: 2, Loss: 0.XXXX  
...  
AUC: 0.XXXX, Accuracy: 0.XXXX  
```

## Metrics Breakdown

### Training Loss
- **What it measures**: How well the model is fitting the training data.  
- **Interpretation**:
  - Lower values indicate a better fit.
  - You should see this decrease over epochs, which means the model is learning.
  - If the loss plateaus (stops decreasing), it suggests the model has learned as much as it can from the data.

### AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
- **What it measures**: The model's ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect responses.  
- **Range**:
  - **0.5**: The model is no better than random guessing.
  - **0.7-0.8**: Acceptable discrimination.
  - **0.8-0.9**: Excellent discrimination.
  - **>0.9**: Outstanding discrimination.
- **Note**: In educational data mining, AUC values around 0.7-0.8 are often considered good.

---

### Accuracy
- **What it measures**: The proportion of predictions that match the actual student responses.  
- **Range**:
  - **0.0 to 1.0** (or **0% to 100%**).
- **Caution**:  
  - Accuracy can be misleading if there's class imbalance (e.g., if students answer correctly most of the time).  
  - This is why AUC is typically preferred, as it is not affected by class imbalance.

## Interpreting the Results

### For Dummy Data (Randomly Generated):
- **AUC**: Near 0.5 (random chance).  
- **Accuracy**: Around 0.5.  
- **Why**: This is expected since the data is randomly generated.

---

### For Real Educational Data:
- **Good results**:
  - Decreasing loss over training epochs.
  - **AUC**: 0.7 or higher.
  - **Accuracy**: Significantly better than the majority class baseline.

The DKVMN model specifically learns to track student knowledge states across time. When properly trained on real data, it should be able to predict future student performance based on their interaction history.
